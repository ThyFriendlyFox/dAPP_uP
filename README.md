# Canvas Drawing App 
An interactive browser-based drawing tool designed with the modern Svelte framework. Users can effortlessly sketch directly onto a canvas that dynamically adapts to the browser window's size. 
## Features 
- **Dynamic Canvas**: The canvas element resizes to fit the entire browser window. 
- **Real-time Drawing**: Utilizes the HTML5 Canvas 2D context for immediate drawing capabilities. 
- **Undo Feature**: Users can revert their most recent changes with a simple CTRL+Z keyboard shortcut. 
- **WebGPU Ready**: Contains placeholders and infrastructure for future integration with the emerging WebGPU API, setting the stage for next-generation graphics rendering.
