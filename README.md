# Canvas Drawing App\n

## Features\n
- **Dynamic Canvas**: The canvas element resizes to fit the entire browser window.\n
- **Real-time Drawing**: Utilizes the HTML5 Canvas 2D context for immediate drawing capabilities.\n
- **Undo Feature**: Users can revert their most recent changes with a simple CTRL+Z keyboard shortcut.\n
